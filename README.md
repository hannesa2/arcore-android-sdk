ARCore SDK for Android
======================
Copyright 2017 Google LLC

This SDK provides APIs for all of the essential AR features like motion
tracking, environmental understanding, and light estimation. With these
capabilities you can build entirely new AR experiences or enhance existing apps
with AR features.

## Main difference to upstream

It provieds a all-in-one sample, and installed apk from release will update your apk an new releases. 
Github works similar to Google playstore as apk provider

## Deprecation policy

Apps built with **ARCore SDK 1.12.0 or higher** are covered by the
[Cloud Anchor API deprecation policy](//developers.google.com/ar/distribute/deprecation-policy).

Apps built with **ARCore SDK 1.11.0 or lower** will be unable to host or resolve
Cloud Anchors beginning December 2020 due to the SDK's use of an older,
deprecated ARCore Cloud Anchor service.
